                A senior at the University of Delaware studying Computer Science with a Concentration in Cyber Security. While in college, I intern at Booz Allen Hamilton on a Defense Contract for the Army where I look at knowledge graphs and understand how to characterize data with respect to Cyber Security. Over the summer, I am participating in a pre-accelerate for a startup, where I am looking to build a business model that supports finding the industry problems with Cyber Security Education.
